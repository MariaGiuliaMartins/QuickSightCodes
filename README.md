# QuickSight Codes
This repository aims to have all the codes I have developed to help me with most of QuickSight's issues.

## What do I use QuickSight for?
By the time I write this, I'm currently a Data Analyst at Encora - Brazil division and I deal with QuickSight daily. I use QuickSight mainly to build dashboards but, of course, I do other stuff besides building up nice visualizations. For this reason, I've created this repository where I share the codes that helped me the most during some tasks!
